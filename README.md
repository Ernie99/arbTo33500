arbTo33500
==========
Several waveforms are created to test an Agilent 33522B AWG. A Mini-Circuits ZFMIQ-10M 9 to 11 MHz I&Q modulator is used with a CW source to generate SSB and AM signals. Similar signals are also generated directly, without the external mixer. The file “arbTo33500.m” from matlabcertral is used as a starting point (see link below). “Agilent visa” and “Matlab” is required to run.
